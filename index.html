                    <i>
                        The purpose of this protocol, is to ensure that every Preseed Team members’
                        communication is effective
                        and uniform so that we all follow certain protocols that define our
                        communications
                        well with each other.
                        Key here is to be fast and mindful. Empathise with other team members who you
                        are
                        communicating with.
                        Any questions or suggestions please feel free to share with the Coordinators.

                    <li>Team communication happens on Whatsapp, Slack and Telegram. These are our our
                        work
                        spaces.</li>
                    <li>Communication be instant please. Have the above apps, Gdrive, Gmail and Trello
                        on
                        all your devices so as
                        to avoid delay in replies.</li>
                    <li>People already get a lot of actionable emails to deal with on a daily basis so
                        cut
                        it out with the
                        repetitive formalities</li>
                    <li>For example “ Hi! How are you”, unless you are really concerned. How is the
                        weather
                        etc.“ I mean just
                        get straight to the point.</li>
                    <li>Communication of Preseed team on Slack (even between 2 individuals) is
                        encouraged to happen on relevant ​*team channels / groups*​ and ​*not DM’s*​ so that the rest of the team can be
                        included as well as learn from the conversation that takes place. Another reason is to be able to
                        amplify the reach of messages (when needed) and protocols from Preseed team to reach other teams in
                        Preseed — which in turn maximizes the impact of the talk. Following this will also reduce redundancy on
                        similar matters of discussion. For ex. check this screenshot</li>

                        <i>
                           1. First and most important protocol no excuse would be accepted for any low quality work. Maintain standards.<br>
    2. Communication at Light Speed. Team members must acknowledge and respond due diligently. Absolutely no failure in work will be tolerated due communication lag.<br>
    3. All hackers working on pages should setup repositories in their own github account. ie. they should host the pages while in development stage on their github account for exchanging opinions in the workgroup as screen shots don’t work.<br>
    4. All exchange of opinions on any design while the page is being worked upon should take place on the work group.<br>
    5. If any page has been finalized, same should be mentioned and the live page to be shared in the workgroup. ie. the page that is hosted on the person’s github account (the person who was assigned the task) to be shared here before calling it done. After the page has been approved only then it can be hosted on the preseed account.<br>
    6. When tasks are complete either on producteev of facebook workgroup update as done.<br>
    7. Any Documents made for better direction of tasks should be shared with Yatharth or the Coordinator; Also wait for their inputs. This is a failsafe in case of early corrections.<br>
    8. Check out the documents for coding guidelines.<br>
    9. all new pages must be implemented/coded in the latest available framework versions. ie. for every new design, implementation should start by downloading the fresh version from getbootstrap.com or the framework being used for laying out the design.<br>
    10. Makes pull requests with relevant descriptions.<br>
    11. Structure. Structure. This includes updating the commit text on Github<br><br>
    
    Please have a proper structure to the codes. Folder structure:<br><br>
    
    Directory structure to be-<br><br>
    1. assets/css/ — for css<br>
    2. assets/img/- for images<br>
    3. assets/js/ — for javascript<br>
    4. bootstrap/css- for css files which come along with bootstrap<br>
    5. bootstrap/js/ — for js files of bootstrap<br>
    6. index.html- home page<br>
    7. assets/fonts- for fonts<br>

                            The purpose of the Feedback Response Policy is important for shaping our product. Instead of reaching out to new users it is important for us to first know our existing users through feedback and serve them really well. We need to know how they're using our product and how we can make the product better suit their needs.
    Every new feature should have a strong feedback system.
    
    Tech team members must know what platform is the feedback coming from, to who, and from who, in the team (for ex. Whatsapp, Facebook messenger, Gmail, Freshdesk etc.). Also, keep a close track on- what percentage of feedbacks are coming from which platform. Keeping a track of the platforms will somewhere help while formulating marketing strategies because we'll know what platforms our users mostly use. We would know the unique user the feedback is coming from but for analysis purpose we will have to club the feedbacks together that are similar in nature to see the ones that are common. While some feedbacks may look similar but in reality they might be very different from each other. So clubbing of feedbacks need to be done intelligently. The bottom line is we have to know what the users are trying to tell us, and try to ensure that it's taken care of. This will lead to a healthy business and formation of a company with a strong foundation that has the customer's best interest in its heart.

                                The most exciting learning moment of it all was 'how to build an ego less
                                company' - What does that even mean? It means a company without any door or
                                roof or body or shape. No, ego less company is not a word that has been used
                                ever perhaps, I coined it to explain yet another fundamentally different
                                attribute of our company. The advantage of running a company like this is
                                that I don't have to waste too much time in hiring or firing people, people
                                can come in freely and walk out freely. THE GOODNESS OF THIS STRATEGY LIES
                                IN THE FACT THAT THOSE WHO COME IN AND DON'T LEAVE.

                            <br><br> I put the first word about Preseed in feb of 2012. Since then we have
                            come a
                            long way forward. From no money in my pocket and 1 person to no money in my
                            pocket and 15+ people team. That means a lot of things, but this post is not
                            about what all that could means, since, all that I have already indicated
                            across my various writings about Preseed. This post is to describe how I

                            One of the greatest difficulties that I face in running a company like
                            Preseed in the world of people who have much greater egos than their
                            knowledge (obviously, for, ego and knowledge are inversely proportional) is
                            handling people with my little tolerance to bull shit excuses, careless
                            attitude towards my company and mediocrity. Oftentimes their inflated egos
                            make them want to quit immediately after that rare outburst from me. <br><br>
                            Well obviously there is a good in even that event of that person leaving,
                            the problem is the going also creates that negative vibe in the company
                            because the company of individuals does not understand that coming and going
                            is no big deal in a liberal culture like that <br><br>
                            One needs to understand that if I pasted them they must have deserved it.
                            Any way startup life is not so rosy and even the rose comes with thorns. If
                            you can keep taking those blows and keep moving forward for the sake of our
                            mission, then you most definitely deserve a chance not only to hold the
                            stock but to lead one day for you listened well from those whose sincerity
                            in Preseed is unquestionable. You need to understand that if I pasted you, I
                            did it in the best interest of our company which is one thing you can’t
                            doubt. Try it. <br><br>
                            For me the best interest of preseed matters far over and above pleasing
                            anyone. I am easy but those who are careless may not find me that easy after
                            all. Find out about the strictness of Sri Yukteswara’s attributes as a
                            teacher to Sri Yogananda Parhamansa and Steve Jobs/Elon Musk/Larry Page’s
                            strictness as leaders of their teams. <br><br>

                            For ego stock post — 
                            <br><br>
                            I don’t know about 2015 but I know if in 2014 I am doing anything that does not
                            relate to Todoed then it is not the right way to go for me. I am saying that I
                            have brought Preseed to a point where as long as it has you guys hustling
                            together it will keep moving forward as long as each one has the intent to be
                            there for each other. As long as that is there we have a structure and spirit to
                            build an extraordinary company out of such relations we are forging. <br> <br>
                            Anyway, so I am saying that please run the company smoothly so smoothly that I
                            don’t have to interfere. <br> <br>
                            If I am found doing anything else in the company other that building Chattodo
                            then know without me saying,that you guys are not doing it right. I need to
                            focus only on Chattodo. For everything else I have laid the foundation very
                            thoughtfully in such a way that it can all be handled with my continued
                            directions which will always be there, especially given that I have already
                            written everything in detail all the way to the next 5 years of our works
                            forward. Now we just have to fill the dots most of which are already indicated.
                            Basically, I feel the blueprint is already created. Now we have to see how well
                            you guys collaborate among each other and cooperate with each other. Just
                            remember it is important to empathize with those you work with to truly
                            understand their situations and intent at all times. That will help you make
                            right and righteous decisions for each one of us. <br> <br>
                            Please work hard. Preseed will not only be a mulit billion-dollar company but
                            will also be a company that will inspire generations through truth and
                            unparalleled transparency.

                    How are teams built? - Other team members' contribution to finding new talents for their team is
                    paramount.
                    Each one should take upon themselves in growing their teams. So I am clearly saying if you talent
                    around you
                    with counter culture beliefs that resonate with Preseed values, create introductions of such people with
                    us,
                     along with your views on what agenda could we build upon with the fellow being you have found for

                    Delegation of work - MOST IMPORTANT Everyone must learn over a period of time of course, 'the art of
                    building their own team'. <br> The biggest attribute we see in our people is 'how well can they inspire
                    others to
                    work with them' if you need money to build your team then you need to see how Nishchal is building his

                        Dear distribution artists, <br>
                        I understand what goes into putting marketing strategies for viral distribution of the
                        web
                        products.
                        It is more of an art than app designing is. <br>
                        Lets first discuss that part of the marketing that is about acquiring users only: <br>
                        <br>
                        We need 1 extra ordinary marketer who could -: <br>
                        1. 100% organic marketing. We mean it. There will be no money for promotions (even if
                        money
                        is
                        not a
                        problem for us) for marketing at this stage of startups at Preseed Projects. So you got
                        to
                        know

                        hacks of the web marketing and distribution world. <br>
                        2. Have faith that this job is the key to helping some really inspired founders and
                        developers
                        in
                        changing the world. <br>
                        You need to be well networked in the global tech media community and should be active on
                        Hacker
                        News, redditt, Twitter, Product Hunt, relevant media and other popular platforms that
                        can be
                        mighty
                        useful to create an initial buzz. You need to be our exact definition of a new age web
                        hustler.

                design sensibility and leadership fire to inspire a team of designers. Over the past few
                years
                we have learned that designers in themselves are a very different type of leader - one

                need to balance out the Reactor Core. There are countless projects related to design

                on in
                Preseed and your role would require you to have hawkeyes over them along with the team
                of
                extraordinary talent built around you. If your values resonate with ours - connect with
                someone
                in the team, but before that - apply.</span><br>

                <strong>Partner the geeks and hustlers and create marketable products by
                    design.</strong>
                This is where extraordinary front end men and women look after those aspects of the
                product
                that the users will interact with. This is the team that finally makes Preseed products
                marketable by design. <br><br>
                This stage for Preseed typically starts when the initial idea is prototyped into a MVP
                and
                now it is time for it to start interacting with the users. <br><br>
                Now let me elaborate a very important remark I just made, ‘ The team that makes products
                marketable by design’, through the eyes of Preseed -: <br><br>
                Step 1 — We get the geeks to hear our ideas, get inspired, code and deliver the MVP of
                the
                idea discussed. Until this point they handle the front end as hackers not as designers.
                This
                works to speedily get prototypes ready for our testing, may be sometimes even private
                beta
                launch because ‘we like to launch fast, even if the design is rather embarrassing’.
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <img src="./img/reid.png" alt="" class="img img-responsive">
                <br><br>
                Step 2 — The MVP is now ready for the play. Remember it is still not the best UI even
                though
                we can imagine it, for we don’t think we want to spend our resources to create the best
                UI
                for it yet, for it first needs to be launched to the real users. So once the MVP is
                tested
                privately, we open the exact same thing for the users, and then continue iterating till
                we
                see some customer traction <br><br>
                Step 3 — This is when you come in. At this stage we have some real customer metrics.
                This is
                really when an idea starts looking like it is ready and worthy of more resources. The
                MVP
                now has a hand full of users using it, while it had designs that were not the kinds we
                would
                like to see in products we use as users. So clearly it is a good sign that the product
                is
                making sense even though it is not well designed. <br><br>
                Step 4 — Marketing through design. Do you know what we mean? This is when the products
                are
                brought to the team at Ugly MVP. This is when Preseed Web Lab finds its front end
                artists.
                <br><br>
                Step 5 — Once we have created a UI that work, we start distributing the product, through
                media, popular bloggers, relevant forums, early adopters, distribution apps etc.
                <br><br>
                Step 6 — We keep trying till we either fail or we succeed. <br><br>
                Step 7 — We move on to our next product. <br><br>
                Design is more important than engineering in the consumer web space. One of the problems
                we
                see in this space in India is not of that of engineering. In fact India produces strong
                engineers. It’s a problem of design, for India seriously lacks consumer web ‘design’
                sensibilities. The reason stands — lack of geeks here marrying some seriously cool
                people.
                We hope that someday we are able to teach that to India through our products. <br><br>
                For now we are looking for just 1 user interaction designer who is willing to commit
                themselves to Preseed and its products/startups/clients. We won’t pay these designers
                any
                salary or immediate compensation. We will instead offer the designers upto 2% ownership
                in
                Preseed soon enough perhaps immediately after 3 months of our active working
                relationship.
                If you are willing, read <a

                </a> note. <br><br>
                Note -: Preseed is going to command substantial ownerships in a lot of future startups.
                Even
                1% ownership at Preseed may be of a huge monetary value someday. <br><br>

                Dear distribution artists, <br>
                I understand what goes into putting marketing strategies for viral distribution of the
                web
                products.
                It is more of an art than app designing is. <br>
                Lets first discuss that part of the marketing that is about acquiring users only: <br>
                <br>
                We need 1 extra ordinary marketer who could -: <br>
                1. 100% organic marketing. We mean it. There will be no money for promotions (even if
                money
                is
                not a
                problem for us) for marketing at this stage of startups at Preseed Projects. So you got
                to
                know
                the
                hacks of the web marketing and distribution world. <br>
                2. Have faith that this job is the key to helping some really inspired founders and
                developers
                in
                changing the world. <br>
                You need to be well networked in the global tech media community and should be active on
                Hacker
                News, redditt, Twitter, Product Hunt, relevant media and other popular platforms that
                can be
                mighty
                useful to create an initial buzz. You need to be our exact definition of a new age web
                hustler.
                This
                guy should communicate like a bullet. <br>
                If you are this guy, write to me at <a href="mailto:nishchal@preseed.in">nishchal@preseed.in</a>
                with the subject 'Preseed Project marketer'.

Almost always, we do things that circles the virtual world of codes with extraordinary hackers - if you feel you are capable of manning such an extraordinary team with simple values - write to us!

                  We value simplicity - in our world we pride ourselves on our design aesthetics. This opening is not for anyone who feel their vibes flow strong with ours, unless you are someone with a subtle design sensibility and leadership fire to inspire a team of designers. Over the past few years we have learned that designers in themselves are a very different type of leader - one we would need to balance out the Reactor Core.  There are countless projects related to design going on in Preseed and your role would require you to have hawkeyes over them along with the team of extraordinary talent built around you. If your values resonate with ours - connect with someone in the team, but before that - apply.
